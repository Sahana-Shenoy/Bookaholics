Academic Books is one section of the market which has not been properly explored and is still governed by small shops in the vicinity of schools and colleges.
Presently, people have limited options with some very rare old book stores within the city where they live.
Bookaholics is a website that facilitates the selling of pre-owned books. Mainly focussing on textbook selling, Bookaholics aims to help students sell their books at reasonable prices.
